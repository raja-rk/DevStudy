1. Install Java SE 17 (JDK)
-https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk17-windows
-Locate java 17's Bin folder in local PC and put its path into environtment variables(C-->Program files-->java-->java-17-->Bin)

2. Install VS Code
https://code.visualstudio.com/download

3. Extension: Extension Pack For Java

Running Java Code:-
1. JShell: JShell, or Java Shell, is an interactive tool that helps people learn Java programming and prototype Java code.
    No need for javac: JShell reads source code and runs it on the fly.

2. Java is patform indepedent as it will run in any machine that have JVM installed on it.
    Running java code requires "JVM".

    Java High Level Language Code(.java) --> Java Compiler(javac) 
    --> Byte code (Low Level Language Code)(.class) --> JDK: [JVM(run the code) + JRE(contains libraries)]

Data Types:-
int -> byte, short, int , long
float -> double, float
char
boolean

Int - 4Bytes
Long - 8Bytes
short - 2Bytes
byte - 1Bytes (-2^7 - 2^7-1)
Float - 4Bytes
double - 8Bytes (by default point values are double in java)
char - 2Bytes
    Java use 'Unicode' instead of 'ascii' to store characters in memory
Boolean - 1bit - t/f

Opertors
Conditional statements
Switch case statement
break statement
loops - while, for , do while

Object oriented programming:-
Method overloading - multiple function with same name within one class

**In Java, memory is divided into two main areas: the stack and the heap. The stack is a fixed-size memory area that is used to store local variables and function calls. 
**The heap is a dynamic memory area that is used to store objects and class instances. 
**In Java, a class without an access modifier is considered package-private. This means that it is only accessible to other classes within the same package. It is less restrictive than private but more restrictive than protected and public.
